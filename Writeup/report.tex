  A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
  article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
  or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
  article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
  as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
  preparation of the documentation of their work.

\section{Introduction}
Dead code causes unnecessary bloat, often can be easily removed, blah blah blah.
Maybe give like 2 paragraphs about this.

\section{Implementation}
Here we can talk about what we actually did.
\subsection{If Statements}

The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmsmall|}: The default journal template style.
\item {\verb|acmlarge|}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\verb|acmtog|}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|acmconf|}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\verb|sigchi|}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\verb|sigchi-a|}: Used for SIGCHI ``Extended Abstract'' articles.
\item{\verb|sigplan|}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{While Loops}
We can eliminate code in while loops blah blah blah

\subsection{For Loops}
We can eliminate code in for loops blah blah blah

\subsection{Useless Variables}
If a variable isn't used we can remove it blah blah blah

\section{Testing Methodology}
I'm thinking our main metric should be file size in bytes, since this is the main 
purpose of dead code elimination. We can also measure speed as well, but make it clear 
that it isn't as significant

\section{Results}

We'll use tables, charts, and other stuff to make our basic testing look fancy.
The better it looks, the more it'll look like we tried.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\section{Conclusion}

We can talk about our results and talk about how the simple examples could 
extend to bigger examples and that big code bases need dead code elim. Blah blah blah.
